The essence: the lighter (of the color), the better.

Good (commercial) brands:

- Barilla (5 stars)
  - This brand can be found everywhere, and that's the advantage
- **Garofalo** (not rated)
  - It is also a good choice
- **Granoro** (6 stars)
  - *Note:* **Granoro** has different versions (i.e. specialty and normal) of pasta. Buy specialty if you can (and afford).
- **Rummo** (7 stars)
- **La Molisana** (7.5 stars)
  - **Rummo** (7 stars) and **De Cecco**  (6.5 stars) are alternatives to **La Molisana** (almost same price, slightly worse quality)
